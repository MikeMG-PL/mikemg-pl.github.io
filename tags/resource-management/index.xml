<p>Resource management in game engines is a wide term, from handling newly exported assets to managing assets loaded into memory in a specific form for particular engine modules. In this article I describe the most basic form of resource management â€“ based on reference counting and sharing one resource allocated in memory. <strong>WhyÂ isÂ thisÂ soÂ important?</strong></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I present this topic in context of a simple game engine I coworked on. My team and I developed a simple game engine, and a game made with it, in <strong>4 months</strong> for courses conducted by the <a href="https://p.lodz.pl/en">Lodz University of Technology</a>.</p>
<p>You can check the project <a href="/portfolio/guiding-light/">right there</a> â€“ more technical aspects of the engine are presented under this link, but I will also delve into some details in this post, where needed. But now, let&rsquo;s answer the question from the introduction: <strong>Why is resource management so important, even in simple custom game engines and educational projects?</strong></p>
<p>By writing this post I want to guide mostly rookie engine devs, based on my contribution to our student project. That results in a few significant aspects you need to know, before you dive into the post&hellip;</p>
